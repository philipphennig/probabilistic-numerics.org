  abstract =	 {This manuscript proposes a probabilistic framework for
                  algorithms that iteratively solve unconstrained linear
                  problems Bx=b with positive definite B for x. The goal is to
                  replace the point estimates returned by existing methods with
                  a Gaussian posterior belief over the elements of the inverse
                  of B, which can be used to estimate errors. Recent
                  probabilistic interpretations of the secant family of
                  quasi-Newton optimization algorithms are extended. Combined
                  with properties of the conjugate gradient algorithm, this
                  leads to uncertainty-calibrated methods with very limited
                  cost overhead over conjugate gradients, a self-contained
                  novel interpretation of the quasi-Newton and conjugate
                  gradient algorithms, and a foundation for new nonlinear
                  optimization methods.},
